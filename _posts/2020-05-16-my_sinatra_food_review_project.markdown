I was quite nervous at first before starting my Sinatra Project but surprisingly, I really enjoyed working on this project. I decided to make my project on daily food reviews where users can sign in/login to see their own or other people’s food review and of course, users are able to create, destroy or even update their previous food reviews. This website would give each user the chance to share their food experiences with everyone around the world. Building this Sinatra Project has really taught me to understand how important it is to *stay organize* and *plan ahead*. Working with the routes and watching how it brings everything together into an actual website was definitely a great experience. Learning new ways of abstraction was also fun as well! For instance, the helpers method was able to cut it short by saving time and space in my code.  CSS was the part where it took time to put some life and colors into my website but that was the best part! I was able to design it in any way I like. Overall, I’ve come to truly appreciate this project and look forward to what comes next on this journey.

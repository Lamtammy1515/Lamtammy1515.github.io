I was originally taking a couple of courses to get into the medical field. It was something both my parents have always wanted me to do. I think it’s great but unfortunately, the profession was just not for me. I did many research on different types of careers but grew zero interest in them. One of my friend, whom I reached out to, is a network engineer. I asked him a couple of questions about his career and he recommended me to do software engineer. In all honesty, I have never really did much research in the IT field and was also unaware of what a Software Engineer really does. After doing my research, I grew a strong interest in this profession and finally decided to apply at Flatiron School. It’s one of the greatest decisions I’ve made in my life and after one week into the Software Engineering course, I’ve really enjoyed the lessons and live lectures with my coaches. Software Engineer is like a puzzle, we’re using technology to solve a real life problem. Being able to be creative and learn new things everyday is what truly gets me more determined to become a Software Engineer. Everyday is going to be a new challenge and I am more than excited to begin this journey with Flatiron school.

This last project was definitely one of the challenging ones. I built an application with Ruby on Rails as the backend and React/Redux on the frontend. It’s a very simple application where users can post about their meal experiences and as well, write as many comments as they wish on their own or other people’s meal posts. I wanted to keep this application as simple as possible to get a stronger understanding of the flow of React/Redux architecture. With many different components built out, I definitely needed to keep track of what each component was responsible for. Components are practically the building blocks of the application but of course, they can either be responsible for displaying something in the DOM or modify a specific behavior. Unfortunately, this project isn’t exactly complex nor the greatest in looks but I’m still proud in terms of what I did with my CSS. Overall, I had an awesome experience with this last project and seeing how everything pulls together, it definitely gives you a stronger understanding as to how it all connects. I certainly have much more to learn as a software engineer but that’s the fun it in! It just feels unreal that school has finally come to an end, but I’ve honestly had an amazing experience here at Flatiron School and I can’t wait to experience life as a software engineer in the real world!

Before starting this project, I was overwhelmed and unsure about what I wanted to do for my project. After careful research, I’ve finally decided to do my project on the website called “The Movie Database.” It was hard at first but as I kept building my codes along the way, it got easier giving me a much stronger understanding on APIs and how they work. Doing this project has honestly taught me to just trust the process. You also start to learn that it does take time and patience because your code isn’t always going to work the first couple of times. Building my CLI class was probably my favorite part of the whole project because that’s where you can get creative and display whatever you want in the terminal for the user to see. My project is actually based on the different genres and tv shows the user can choose from to see an overview of whichever show they were most interested in. Overall, this project was a great experience and I’m really looking forward to the next couple of projects coming up.

Though my project isn’t exactly the greatest, I can now proudly say I’ve finally built my first rails application from SCRATCH! This project was quite challenging, and I did spend a myriad of hours debugging but I learned a lot out of it and the feeling after fixing a bug is absolutely satisfying. Even when I have no idea why my code works but it works! LOL. One of the few issues I had was trying to focus on completing one task at a time. For instance, I’d work on my log in page and without even finishing, I’d jump into doing something else like creating more nested resources or jumping into different view files creating forms, links, etc. I’ll definitely try to manage my focus and organization better next time around but that’s okay! We’re here to learn and improve on our skills day by day. The best part to me, however, is always styling HTML & CSS. Unfortunately, I didn’t spend too much time designing my rails application due the small time frame I had left but at least, I got to do a couple of things so that was really cool. Overall, I’ve really enjoyed building this rails project. It was intimidating at first but once everything pulled together into a website, it was honestly astonishing and inspiring.
